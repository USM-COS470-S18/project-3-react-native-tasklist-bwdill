# Hybrid Task List

## Useage
To add a task press the plus button in the upper right corner. This will bring up the add task modal where you can enter a task name and description.
There will also be a button to pick a date and bring up the date picker. Along with a button to mark the task as complete or incomplete
From the task list menu you can press the complete or incomplete button on each item of the task list

## Special Info
The only part of this app I couldnt get working was the edit feature. When you tap on list item the edit task model was appearing inside the view of the tasklist item. I was having trouble getting the onPress method of the task list item to show its modal on over the entire task list view.

## Lesson Learned
I learned planning the app a little better would have helped. It turned out the way I added a data file in an attempt to store info separatly just ended up over complicating things. By the time I started to realise it was too late to redo the entire app. I should have just made a simple array instead of doing a separate data file with keys
